# Better Save Slots C Copy & Paste + 108 Save Slots

# Introduction
I actually planned to make this mod a long time ago, but since the developers added more save slots midway, I put it aside for a while.

# Features

## Quick Save Copying

The main feature is adding **Copy** and **Paste** buttons to every save slot.

After clicking **Copy**, you can click **Paste** on any slot to copy the save *together with its backups*.

When pasting, the game will ask whether you want to overwrite the target slot.

Pasting includes all backups, making archive management more convenient.

## Additional Save Slots

Go to the `JmcModLibConfig` folder under your save directory, open `BetterSaveSlot.json`, and modify the value of **“ExtraSaveSlotCount”**.

Or, after installing **ModSetting**, you can simply modify it in-game.  
You can add up to **102 extra slots**. Combined with the game’s 6 default slots, you can have up to **108 save slots**:

I think 108 save slots should be more than enough for most players!
