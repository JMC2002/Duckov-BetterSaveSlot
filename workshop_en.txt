[h1]Better Save Slots – Copy & Paste + 108 Save Slots[/h1]

[h2]Introduction[/h2]
I actually planned to make this MOD a long time ago, but during development the official game added more save slots, so I postponed it.

[h2]Features[/h2]

[h3]Quick Save Copying[/h3]
The main feature is adding a copy & paste function to every save slot.

After clicking Copy, you can click Paste to copy a save file (including its backups) into another slot.

A confirmation window will appear before overwriting an existing save.

Pasting also copies all backups, making save management easier.

[h3]Additional Save Slots[/h3]

To modify the number of extra save slots, go to your save directory, open the **JmcModLibConfig** folder, and edit the value of “Extra Save Slot Count” inside **BetterSaveSlot.json**.

Or, if you have ModSetting installed, you can adjust the value directly in game.  
You can add up to 102 extra slots. Combined with the game's built-in 6 slots, you can have up to **108** save slots:

I think 108 slots should be enough for most people!
